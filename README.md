FDCP module 2 - web dev basics, html + CSS. Final assignment. <br><br>
Instructions: create a web site introducing your home town, favorite place etc.<br><br>
I chose three locations in different parts of Sweden. I purposely went with locations that are probably not the most well known to foreign tourists. This decision also led me to add coordinates, linked to Google Earth.<br><br>
Design wise, I used the Image Picker Tool at Coolors.co to create a palette from the header background image. The body background color is a dark blue shade and the yellow border color is picked from the lights along the bridge.
